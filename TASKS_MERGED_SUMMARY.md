## 💡 Tips

### Using "Start Task" Effectively

1. **One task at a time**: Complete each task fully before moving to the next
2. **Review the code**: Always review what Kiro generates
3. **Test thoroughly**: Test each feature before moving forward
4. **Read implementation docs**: Kiro generates docs for each task
5. **Ask questions**: If something isn't clear, ask Kiro to explain

### Task Dependencies

- **Task 28** must be done first (foundation)
- **Tasks 29-31** depend on Task 28
- **Tasks 32-37** can be done after Task 31
- **Tasks 38-41** can be done after Task 31
- **Tasks 42-43** can be done anytime after Task 31
